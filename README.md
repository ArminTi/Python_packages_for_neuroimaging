# Python_packages_for_neuroimaging_Recap
All things you want to know.

One of the main problems we might face in data analysis is working with different programming languages. At least for me, working on a project for a few months with MATLAB might come with forgetting important functions in Python, and vice versa. When you get back to Python after a few months, you won’t remember the important functions — and that is disturbing. To tackle this issue, I collect examples and cheat notes to recap important functions, without any redundant parts. The examples come from Data Science for Neuroimaging: An Introduction by Ariel Rokem and Tal Yarkoni, and custom projects and practices I had.
